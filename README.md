# sw_modification
This is a program written by myself and William DeBliek as a final project for Bioinformatics class. It is a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm which outputs more than one homolog in a gene sequence as opposed to the common Smith-Waterman algorithm, which only outputs one homolog. This project is a work in progress.
