# sw_modification
This is a program written by myself and William DeBliek as a final project for Bioinformatics class. It is a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm which outputs more than one homolog in a gene sequence as opposed to the common Smith-Waterman algorithm, which only outputs one homolog. This project is a work in progress. The functions for finding and returning the homologs are written and work correctly. However, the final function to split and re-run the program is not functional yet.
